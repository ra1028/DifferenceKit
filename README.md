## Algorithm
The algorithm used in DifferenceKit is optimized based on the Paul Heckel's algorithm.  
See also his paper ["A technique for isolating differences between files"](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359467) released in 1978.  
[RxDataSources](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxDataSources) and [IGListKit](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit) are also implemented based on his algorithm.  
This allows all types of differences to be computed in linear time **O(n)**.  

However, in `performBatchUpdates` of UITableView and UICollectionView, there are combinations of commands that cause crash when applied simultaneously.  
To solve this problem, DifferenceKit takes an approach of split the set of differences at the minimal stages that can be perform batch-updates with no crashes.

Implementation is [here](https://github.com/ra1028/DifferenceKit/blob/master/Sources/Algorithm.swift).

## Documentation
⚠️ Since DifferenceKit is currently released in alpha version, updates may contain breaking changes.  
See docs in [GitHub Pages](https://ra1028.github.io/DifferenceKit/).

## Getting Started
- [Example app](https://github.com/ra1028/DifferenceKit/blob/master/Examples)
- [Playground](https://github.com/ra1028/DifferenceKit/blob/master/DifferenceKit.playground/Contents.swift)

### Example codes
The type of the element that to take the differences must be conform to the `Differentiable` protocol.  
The `differenceIdentifier`'s type is determined generic by the associated type:
```swift
struct User: Differentiable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String

    var differenceIdentifier: Int {
        return id
    }

    func isContentEqual(to source: User) -> Bool {
        return name == source.name
    }
}
```

In the case of definition above, `id` uniquely identifies the element and get to know the user updated by comparing equality of `name` of the elements in source and target.

There are default implementations of `Differentiable` for the types that conformed to `Equatable` or `Hashable`：
```swift
extension String: Differentiable {}
```

You can calculate the differences by creating `StagedChangeset` from two collections of elements conforming to `Differentiable`:
```swift
let source = [
    User(id: 0, name: "Vincent"),
    User(id: 1, name: "Jules")
]
let target = [
    User(id: 1, name: "Jules"),
    User(id: 0, name: "Vincent"),
    User(id: 2, name: "Butch")
]

let changeset = StagedChangeset(source: source, target: target)
```

If you want to include multiple types conformed to `Differentiable` in the collection, use `AnyDifferentiable`:
```swift
let source = [
    AnyDifferentiable("A"),
    AnyDifferentiable(User(id: 0, name: "Vincent"))
]
```

In the case of sectioned collection, the section itself must have a unique identifier and be able to compare whether there is an update.  
So each section must conform to `DifferentiableSection` protocol, but in most cases you can use `ArraySection` that general type conformed to it.  
`ArraySection` requires a model conforming to `Differentiable` for differentiate from other sections:
```swift
enum Model: Differentiable {
    case a, b, c
}

let source: [ArraySection<Model, String>] = [
    ArraySection(model: .a, elements: ["A", "B"]),
    ArraySection(model: .b, elements: ["C"])
]
let target: [ArraySection<Model, String>] = [
    ArraySection(model: .c, elements: ["D", "E"]),
    ArraySection(model: .a, elements: ["A"]),
    ArraySection(model: .b, elements: ["B", "C"])
]

let changeset = StagedChangeset(source: source, target: target)
```

You can incremental updates UITableView and UICollectionView using the created `StagedChangeset`.  
**Don't forget** to update the data referenced by the dataSource in `setData` closure, as the differences is applied in stages:
```swift
tableView.reload(using: changeset, with: .fade) { data in
    dataSource.data = data
}
```

Batch-updates using too large amount of differences may adversely affect to performance.  
Returning `true` with `interrupt` closure then falls back to `reloadDate`:
```swift
collectionView.reload(using: changeset, interrupt: { $0.changeCount > 100 }) { data in
    dataSource.data = data
}
```

## Comparison with Other Frameworks
Made a fair comparison as much as possible in features and performance with other **popular** and **awesome** frameworks.  
⚠️ This does `NOT` determine superiority or inferiority of the frameworks. I know that each framework has different benefits.

### Performance comparison
Performance was measured using `XCTestCase.measure` on iPhoneX simulator with `-O -whole-module-optimization`.  
Use `Foundation.UUID` as an element.  

⚠️ If Move is included in the difference, performance may obviously decrease in some frameworks.  
⚠️ *DeepDiff may had increased the processing speed by misuse of Hashable in algorithm.*
